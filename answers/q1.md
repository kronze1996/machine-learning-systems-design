# Answer to question 1

**Question 1**

Duolingo is a platform for language learning. When a student is learning a new language, Duolingo wants to recommend increasingly difficult stories to read.
	- How would you measure the difficulty level of a story?
	- Given a story, how would you edit it to make it easier or more difficult?

# Measuring and Editing Story Difficulty in Duolingo

## 1. Measuring the Difficulty Level of a Story

Several factors can contribute to the difficulty of a story:

### a) Vocabulary Complexity:
   - **Frequency of words**: The more common the words, the easier the story. A text with a lot of rare or specialized vocabulary increases difficulty.
   - **Word length and morphology**: Longer words or words with complex affixes might be more difficult for beginners.
   - **Noun, verb, and adjective diversity**: The use of a wide variety of grammatical categories can make the text harder to follow.
   - **Use of synonyms or idioms**: Synonyms, idiomatic expressions, or cultural references that aren't widely known can raise the level of difficulty.

### b) Sentence Structure:
   - **Sentence length**: Shorter, simpler sentences are easier to process. Long, complex sentences with multiple clauses and conjunctions are harder.
   - **Grammatical complexity**: Use of advanced grammatical structures (e.g., passive voice, subjunctive mood, conditional statements) can increase difficulty.
   - **Word order and syntax complexity**: More complex sentence structures or unfamiliar word orders for the learner’s native language might pose difficulties.

### c) Text Cohesion:
   - **Pronoun referencing and conjunctions**: The ease with which learners can follow the narrative and maintain cohesion (linking ideas logically) will influence difficulty.
   - **Coherence of ideas**: Texts that are harder to follow due to their abstract ideas or complex narrative threads will be more difficult to process.

### d) Cultural and Contextual Knowledge:
   - Stories that involve cultural nuances, context-specific references, or slang expressions might be more challenging for learners who are not familiar with that culture or context.

### e) Reading Level Classification Tools:
   - You could use readability tests (e.g., Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level, Gunning Fog Index, or other linguistically based scoring systems) to objectively classify the story’s difficulty based on these metrics.

## 2. Editing a Story to Make It Easier or More Difficult

### a) Making the Story Easier:
   - **Simplify Vocabulary**: Replace less common or more advanced words with simpler synonyms or phrases that are more likely to be understood at lower levels.
     - Example: Replace "purchasing" with "buying" or "mysterious" with "strange."
   - **Shorten Sentences**: Break up long, complex sentences into shorter, more digestible ones.
     - Example: Instead of "He tried to explain the situation to her, but she was too upset to understand," you could say "He tried to explain. She was upset. She didn't understand."
   - **Use More Common Grammatical Structures**: Avoid using advanced structures like the subjunctive mood or passive voice, opting instead for simple present tense and direct sentence structures.
   - **Remove Idiomatic Expressions**: Simplify expressions that might be confusing to learners (e.g., replace "break the ice" with "start a conversation").
   - **Provide Context and Definitions**: Use simpler language but offer context, clarifications, or a glossary for terms that might be challenging for the learner.
     - Example: Include a footnote for a culture-specific word or reference that is important but unfamiliar.
   
### b) Making the Story More Difficult:
   - **Introduce Advanced Vocabulary**: Use more challenging or less common words, idiomatic expressions, and technical terms.
     - Example: Use "acquire" instead of "get," or introduce specialized vocabulary relevant to the story’s theme (e.g., legal or medical terms).
   - **Increase Sentence Length and Complexity**: Use compound or complex sentences that include clauses, subordinating conjunctions, and different verb tenses.
     - Example: Instead of "She went to the store," you could write "After she finished work, she decided to go to the store, though she was unsure if she had enough time before it closed."
   - **Introduce More Complex Grammatical Structures**: Incorporate advanced grammar such as the subjunctive, passive voice, and conditional or future perfect tenses.
   - **Add Cultural or Historical References**: Include references that require cultural or historical knowledge that the learner will need to research or ask about.
   - **Remove Context or Explanation**: Present the story without definitions or direct explanations, assuming the learner has enough background to understand on their own.

## Conclusion
By adjusting the vocabulary, sentence structure, grammatical complexity, and cultural context, Duolingo can ensure that learners progress steadily while being appropriately challenged at each stage. Tailoring these elements allows for effective language learning at any level.
